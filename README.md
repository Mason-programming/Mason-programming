  <summary>📌 Mason's Career Journey </summary>
I am a software application developer passionate about bridging the physical and digital worlds through interactive applications and digital twins. My journey has taken me across theme parks, animation studios, and machine vision, where I’ve built software that enhances both creative and technical workflows.

At Universal Creative, I developed a controls emulation application for Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness, creating a digital twin of the ride’s control system to simulate and test interactions before real-world deployment. This experience reinforced my passion for developing applications that integrate software, simulation, and real-time systems to improve efficiency and performance.

At Walt Disney Animation Studios, I worked as a Technical Director, developing pipeline applications for scene assembly, layout, and animation workflows. My tools helped artists seamlessly transition assets across multiple software platforms, ensuring a fluid creative process. Working at the intersection of software development, automation, and digital content creation gave me a deeper understanding of how software applications drive storytelling.

Now, at ShelfSight Analytics, I am applying my expertise in machine vision and AI-powered automation, developing applications that use real-time object recognition and tracking to enhance inventory management. Beyond my work, I contribute to SIGGRAPH, helping advance research in computer graphics, simulation, and interactive technology. My passion for developing applications that merge software and digital twins continues to drive me, and I am excited about the future of simulation-driven workflows and intelligent automation.
