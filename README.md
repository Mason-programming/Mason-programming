  <summary>📌 Mason's Career Journey </summary>

My career has been shaped by bridging creativity and technology, developing software that enhances storytelling, automation, and interactive experiences. At Walt Disney World, I worked on simulation and training tools, integrating systems to improve efficiency and streamline operations. This led me to Universal Creative, where I built automated testing and visualization tools for theme park attractions, ensuring seamless software-hardware integration.

At Walt Disney Animation Studios, I transitioned into pipeline engineering, creating tools for scene assembly, layout, and asset management. I collaborated with artists and TDs to optimize workflows, integrating VR and USD-based technologies to improve production efficiency and enhance creative flexibility.

Currently, at ShelfSight Analytics, I focus on machine vision and AI-driven automation, developing real-time object recognition systems. My work merges AI, networking, and real-time processing to drive innovation in smart inventory tracking.

Beyond my work, I contribute to SIGGRAPH as an External Reviewer, evaluating advancements in computer graphics and VFX technology. Looking ahead, I aim to continue developing high-performance tools that empower artists, streamline workflows, and push the boundaries of interactive media and real-time technology.
